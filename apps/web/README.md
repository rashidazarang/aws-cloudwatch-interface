# Web Application (Next.js)

This package will host the React/Next.js interface for the AWS CloudWatch Interface project. Milestone M2 will introduce the actual implementation. Planned modules include:

- Authentication flow using Supabase Auth.
- Log group explorer and Logs Insights query builder.
- Results viewer with JSON table and export options.
- Saved query management with tagging and quick recall.

Development notes and scripts will be added once the app scaffold is generated.
